<h2 class="title">equality of languages</h2>

<p>The more I learn new languages, the more debates about who&#39;s language is more performant or just
better I see. Often no reasoning is given. This makes me think that every language is totaly viable
for most of the tasks/projects, only different people have different preferences and affinities.
Especially in the web development world!</p>
<p>Having used PHP, C#, Java, VBScript, XSLT, Javascript, Ruby, Scala and seeing Go, Python, Rust,
C, C++, Objective-C Elixir, Clojure, Haskell all going to war I caught myself thinking that those
can all do the job very well and the metrics we use to compare them don&#39;t really matter.</p>
<p>But, I do not neglect that certain groups of similar languages are way better at their jobs that
other, what I mean by equality is that the speed diference between Ruby, Phython or PHP really
depends on the code you write and what libraries you use more than the language it self, what
matters the most is what you <strong>write</strong>, what you <strong>build</strong>. As programmer we are builders, creators,
the single best thing you can do for your startup / project is to <strong>get to work</strong> and <strong>stop
  worrying</strong> about which technology/language/RDBMS you should choose, pick the ones you are used to,
pick the one that will make you fast and efficient, pick the one your team is used to and make those
keyboard keys sweat.</p>
<p>Then, once you have built something, there is a point in the life of a software where you might need
more performance, more reliabily, more scalability, then, but only then think about rewriting small
parts, learn slowly and adapt yourself.</p>
<p>As for web development here is how I would split those in groups:</p>
<p><em>High level, dynamic, iterative languages to kickoff a project or build a prototype with:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Python Ruby PHP</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Still high level but more complex, with more overhead, performant languages:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Java C# Clojure Haskell Elixir</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lower level, good for cli stuff &amp; ops &amp; heavy filesystem/OSy work:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Go Rust C C++</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL; DR;</strong> Don&#39;t be picky about which language to choose. Pick one you are used to, in the
good category for your kind of project and get working!</p>
