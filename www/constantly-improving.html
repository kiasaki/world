<h2 class="title">constantly improving</h2>

<p>I know I am like that and from few blogs I read recently and conversations I’ve had recently I know there is plenty of other people like this. People with and insatiable quench for learning, for new knowledge.</p>
<p>This feeling is even more prevalent in the IT field where, I you sit on what you acquired up till now, even for just 3 months, you have quite a bit of catching up to do. In other fields with less constant newness it feel less of an imperative but it is as important as for anybody else.</p>
<p>I am infinitely grateful for what I have accomplished and where I am at but when people say I am lucky or ask me simply, how?, I always answer:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s simple, to become a world-class performer you need to never stop doing two things: put in hours and constantly surpass your limits (even if just by a little)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that second part is what makes it possible for someone with 5 years to be 10x better than someone with 20 years of experience. What makes you better and better is what researchers call <em>deliberate practice</em>, the act of practicing over and over what’s core to your skill or craft, it’s not the fun part like a piano concert but that part that people call <em>grinding</em>, playing the same piano song over and over while paying attention to what you are doing wrong and on what you can improve.</p>
<p>The act of deliberate practice can seem like daunting to you and I know what you mean, I played piano when I was younger and as much as I <strong>hated practicing</strong>. I was exhilarated by the end result, the playing the song you learn’t in front of friends in family. What I am getting to is that I eventually stopped playing piano, but, with hacking, programming, I can never get enough of it. Deliberate practice feels fun, I always want more of it, and, in terms, I am even more impressed with the outcomes and end results of my constant learning. And that is <strong>what you should search for</strong>, something that you have a passion for big enough that the parts of it that are boring to other exhilarate you and passionate you.</p>
<p>Go and find that, I you found it already then enjoy and achieve great things!</p>
